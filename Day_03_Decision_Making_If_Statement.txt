Simple logic flow understanding

1. What is Decision Making?

Decision making is used to execute code based on a condition.

In C, decision making is done using:

if

if–else

2. IF Statement

The if statement checks a condition.

If the condition is true, the code inside if executes.

If the condition is false, the code inside if is skipped.

Syntax
if (condition)
{
    // statements
}

3. IF–ELSE Statement

Used when we want to execute one block if condition is true and another block if condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition)
{
    // true block
}
else
{
    // false block
}

4. Relational Operators Used

Relational operators are used to compare two values.

Operator	Meaning
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
==	Equal to
!=	Not equal
5. Example – Comparing Two Numbers
int a = 14;
int b = 12;

if (a > b)
{
    printf("a is greater than b");
}
else
{
    printf("a is less than or equal to b");
}

6. Simple Calculation Using IF
int a = 14;
int b = 12;
int x;

if (a < b)
{
    x = b - a;
}
else
{
    x = a - b;
}

printf("%d", x);

7. Example – Sum Using IF Condition
int i, sum, x;
sum = 0;
i = 0;

if (i < 10)
{
    x = sum + i;
    sum = x;
}

printf("%d", sum);

8. Loop Logic Using IF and GOTO (Basic Understanding)
int i, sum, x;
i = 0;
sum = 0;
x = 0;

loop:
if (i < 10)
{
    x = sum + i;
    sum = x;
    i = i + 1;
    goto loop;
}

printf("%d", sum);

9. Key Learnings

if checks conditions

Conditions return true or false

Relational operators are essential for decision making

if–else helps control program flow
