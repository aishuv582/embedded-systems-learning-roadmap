My embedded systems learning journey with Embedded C, microcontrollers, communication protocols, and RTOS.
# Career Transition: Banking to Embedded Systems 🚀

Hi, I'm Aishwarya 👋  
An Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) graduate currently transitioning from a banking background into the Embedded Systems domain.

While working in the banking sector, I realized my strong interest lies in low-level programming, hardware–software integration, and real-time systems. To pursue this passion, I am actively building my skills through structured learning and hands-on embedded projects.

## 🔄 Why Embedded Systems
- Strong academic foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering
- Genuine interest in programming close to hardware
- Passion for understanding how real-time systems work internally
- Long-term goal to grow as an Embedded Systems Engineer

## 🧠 Skills Under Development
- Embedded C programming
- Microcontroller programming (Arduino / STM32)
- GPIO, timers, interrupts, PWM
- Communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C
- RTOS fundamentals (FreeRTOS)
- Debugging and datasheet analysis

## 🛠 Learning & Practice Approach
- Daily coding and practical experimentation
- Register-level programming wherever applicable
- Hardware-based mini projects
- Consistent progress tracking using GitHub
- Emphasis on clean, readable, and well-documented code

## 📁 Repository Overview
This repository contains:
- C programming exercises for embedded systems
- Microcontroller programs
- Communication protocol implementations
- RTOS experiments
- End-to-end embedded projects

Each section includes source code, explanations, and learning notes.

## 🎯 Career Objective
To successfully transition into an entry-level Embedded Systems Engineer role and contribute to real-world embedded projects while continuously improving my technical skills.

📌 This repository reflects my commitment, consistency, and practical learning journey during this career transition.
